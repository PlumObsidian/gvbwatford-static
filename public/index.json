In that moment I jumped back from the edge and realised I definitely did not want to jump. Guitar and the ability to play it, quite literally saved my life.\nI decided to stop feeling sorry for my loss of professional ability and my sight, so I started this group to share musical skills between members of the local community. From repairing and upcycling old and broken instruments, to imparting knowledge of how to play an instrument in a kind atmosphere, among friendly people with free food and drink, because self worth, and good mental health are intrinsically related.\nIf a single person is able to feel half the benefit that I did playing a tune on an instrument, that gives me an immense feeling of satisfaction.\nWe were incorporated by the charity commission in Feb this year.\nIf you would like to help support us in our goal to bring musical skills knowledge to as many people as possible then please, go to our fundraising page and donate what you can afford or, a donation of time is just as gratefully received.
