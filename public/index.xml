      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;volunteering&#34;&gt;Volunteering&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Volunteering. It feels good and you can learn lots from it. At the Croxley Studio there is so much potential for volunteers to learn some interesting new skills..&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Firstly, this is a safe, non-judgemental space to play the many instruments that are here that have been donated or restored.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We are running classes for instrument building and repair.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Everything is run on a &amp;ldquo;pay-what-you-can&amp;rdquo; donation basis.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We are in the process of building a small but usable recording setup for musicians to get creative with music creation and production software.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you have the interest or skills to run and maintain this &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; do you want  to learn about it?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most of the computers here are now running Linux which is a free, open-source operating system. Whilst this may be initially baffling for some, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to run some tutorials on this if the interest is there.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In particular, what we are finding with the Linux setups is that you can turn an otherwise older pieces of computer equipment that is destined to be e-waste into something like a file server, music jukebox or even a recording studio setup on a discarded laptop.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Linux we have also found to be very customizable for visual impairment or any other use need. It makes computers and technology to people who are otherwise excluded. we have string feels about digital exclusion. Disability happens when something like a piece of software is poorly designed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are you an artist or do you want to contribute to the visual identity of Good Vibrations? Do you want to learn how to build websites for FREE?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are you a writer or do you feel YOU could write good and interesting copy for a blog?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you feel this is something you would be interesting in contributing to, please get in contact with us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-good-vibrations-watford&#34;&gt;What is Good Vibrations Watford?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A not for profit group which aims to provide musical experience, lessons, somewhere safe and warm to be with good people and hot food.&#xA;We take kindly donated musical instruments, repair where needed and offer a space for those in need, to come and relax, have a square meal and possibly learn a beneficial skill for their own development, and maintaining a healthy mind.&#xA;From kind-hearted volunteers to experienced musicians, we take pride in offering a non judgemental, positive outlook because any situation no matter how bad, can be made in some way better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
